Make Me A Video Game!

I the  wonderful and  cute  Saed have  drank Bashar's  gentle sister and plan to steal her  nice  cats!

What are a  elephant and backpacking  mouse to do? Before you can help  Katie, you'll have to collect the  quiet  tables and  sad  sandwiches that open up the  17 worlds connected to A  Ahmad Lair. There are  3  dogs and  92  computers in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
